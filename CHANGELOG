are fixed.

2.1.0 -- added ScientificNameParser.version method

2.0.0 -- backward incompatibe change in parserver, therefore new major number.
In parserver removed option --output=canonical_with_rank, instead added -r
option which allows to have canonical with rank with either json or canonical
outputs

1.2.0 -- changed method invocation signature ScientificNameParser.new
Now it can take options

1.1.3 -- added 'fo' as rank

1.1.2  -- static method for fixins all-caps canonical names, fixing caps
for authors words, ampersand instead of 'et' in normalization

cf., sp. etc), bug fixes, more robust salvage mode

1.0.16 -- dirty mode now converts ë to e

1.0.15 -- additional rules added for names ending with ssp. sp sp. and cf.

version the only utf-8 character allowed in canonical forms should be the
multiplication sign for hybrids.

1.0.13 -- canonical forms for cf. aff. qualifiers are modified: canonical for
'Aus cf. bus' is now 'Aus bus'; canonical for 'Aus aff. bus' is now 'Aus'.
Ranks at the end of the name like 'var', 'ssp', 'spp' are considered junk and
are ignored

1.0.12 -- bug is fixed which prevented 'Cucurbita pepo' be parsed correctly,
f., forma, fr. are now treated as any other ranks.
